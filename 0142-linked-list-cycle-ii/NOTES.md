Let's say there is a hair, which is twice faster than tortoise, and there is a tortoise.
​
1. phase 1
Let's say F is a distance from head to the place where cycle starts, and 'a' is the distance from the the place where cycle starts and hair and tortoise meet.
And C is the total length of cycle.
​
if tortoise moves F+a, and tortoise and hair met, then
2(F+a) = F+a+n*C
F+a = n*C
a = n*C - F
​
=> if hair goes F more step from 'a', it will be at the starting line again.
​
2. phase 2
then, Let's slow down hair to the speed of tortoise, and set tortoise back to the head.
if tortoise goes F more step, and hair goes F more(go with the same speed and meet), they will meet at the place where cycle starts
